L’égalité femmes-hommes, même si elle est en partie inscrite dans la loi, n’est toujours pas une réalité. La société reste patriarcale dans sa structure et dans ses fondements. La domination masculine, en tant que système de privilèges accordés aux hommes, continue d’agir à tous les niveaux. D’autres systèmes de domination existent et s’imbriquent avec pour effet d’imposer à certaines femmes une accumulation des discriminations. De fait, notre féminisme se positionne dans un refus de l’ensemble de ces systèmes néfastes et s’engage à les combattre.", //required
